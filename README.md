# 🚀 100 Days of LeetCode — My Problem Solving Journey

Welcome to my **100 Days of LeetCode** challenge —  
a personal mission to master **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** in Python, sharpen problem-solving skills, and prepare for top tech interviews at Microsoft, Google, and beyond.

This repository is my open diary of logic, mistakes, breakthroughs, and consistency.  
It documents **every day** of my journey — from basic array manipulation to advanced graph algorithms and dynamic programming.

## 🧭 Why This Challenge?

I started this challenge not just to “solve questions,” but to:
- Build a daily habit of **structured problem-solving**.  
- Strengthen **DSA fundamentals** with hands-on coding.  
- Improve **debugging speed**, **pattern recognition**, and **logical clarity**.  
- Document progress publicly for accountability and reflection.  

Every solution here is written with clarity and understanding — not shortcuts.

## 🗓️ Journey Timeline

| Day | Problem | Concept | Takeaway |
|-----|----------|----------|-----------|
| 1 | Two Sum | Brute-force Search | Start simple. Understanding the problem beats guessing the shortcut. |
| 2 | Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock | Greedy Algorithm | The best profits come from patience — and one perfect moment of action. |
| 3 | Product of Array Except Self | Prefix & Suffix Arrays | Sometimes, what matters isn’t your own value — but the product of what’s around you. |
| 3 | Contains Duplicate | Set-based Lookup | Remove the noise early; repetition only slows progress. |
| 4 | Merge Sorted Array | In-place Merge + Sort | Order isn’t given — it’s built, element by element. |
| 5 | Remove Element | Two-pointer Technique | Knowing what to ignore is as important as knowing what to keep. |
| 6 | Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array | Two-pointer Overwrite | Progress means overwriting the old with what truly matters. |
| 6 | Majority Element | Sorting-based Majority | The truth sits right in the middle — if you’re willing to sort through the mess. |
| 7 | Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array II | Two-pointer Technique | Even repetition deserves balance — control, not chaos. |
| 8 | Rotate Array | Slicing Technique | Python slicing is ridiculously powerful once you visualize array movement. |
| 9 | Length of Last Word | String manipulation & iteration | “Easy” isn’t always simple – clean logic trumps clever tricks; pace yourself for real efficiency. |
| 10 | Index of First Occurrence in String | String search (.find()) | Reinventing the wheel isn’t smart – knowing your tools accelerates progress. |
| 11 | Valid Palindrome | Cleaning & reversing strings | Cleaning makes logic clearer — slow down and tidy up for robust solutions. |
| 12 | Valid Parentheses | Stack & dictionary matching | Order—both in code and life—ensures stability; pairs make clean exits. |
| 13 | Palindrome Number | Integer-to-string conversion | Changing formats clears confusion; symmetry emerges with simple transformations. |
| 14 | Plus One | Array-to-string/integer roundtrip | Sometimes the best way is the most direct—even if it retraces kindergarten math. |
| 15 | Factorial Trailing Zeroes | Division & counting factors | Optimization means knowing where zeros hide; divide, count, and spot what matters. |
| 16 | Sqrt(x) | Math library, code clarity | Less is more: embrace built-in solutions instead of overcomplicating. Simplicity often wins over brute force. |
| 17 | Pow(x, n) | Math power, toolkit trust | Elevation, trust reliable tools for power moves—delegation can be the smartest path to perfect performance. |
