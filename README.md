# 🚀 100 Days of LeetCode — My Problem Solving Journey

Welcome to my **100 Days of LeetCode** challenge —  
a personal mission to master **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** in Python, sharpen problem-solving skills, and prepare for top tech interviews at Microsoft, Google, and beyond.

This repository is my open diary of logic, mistakes, breakthroughs, and consistency.  
It documents **every day** of my journey — from basic array manipulation to advanced graph algorithms and dynamic programming.

## 🧭 Why This Challenge?

I started this challenge not just to “solve questions,” but to:
- Build a daily habit of **structured problem-solving**.  
- Strengthen **DSA fundamentals** with hands-on coding.  
- Improve **debugging speed**, **pattern recognition**, and **logical clarity**.  
- Document progress publicly for accountability and reflection.  

Every solution here is written with clarity and understanding — not shortcuts.

## 🗓️ Journey Timeline

| Day | Problem | Concept | Takeaway |
|-----|----------|----------|-----------|
| 1 | Two Sum | Brute-force Search | Start simple. Understanding the problem beats guessing the shortcut. |
| 2 | Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock | Greedy Algorithm | The best profits come from patience — and one perfect moment of action. |
| 3 | Product of Array Except Self | Prefix & Suffix Arrays | Sometimes, what matters isn’t your own value — but the product of what’s around you. |
| 3 | Contains Duplicate | Set-based Lookup | Remove the noise early; repetition only slows progress. |
| 4 | Merge Sorted Array | In-place Merge + Sort | Order isn’t given — it’s built, element by element. |
| 5 | Remove Element | Two-pointer Technique | Knowing what to ignore is as important as knowing what to keep. |
| 6 | Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array | Two-pointer Overwrite | Progress means overwriting the old with what truly matters. |
| 6 | Majority Element | Sorting-based Majority | The truth sits right in the middle — if you’re willing to sort through the mess. |
| 7 | Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array II | Two-pointer Technique | Even repetition deserves balance — control, not chaos. |
| 8 | Rotate Array | Slicing Technique | Python slicing is ridiculously powerful once you visualize array movement. |
| 9 | Length of Last Word | String manipulation & iteration | “Easy” isn’t always simple – clean logic trumps clever tricks; pace yourself for real efficiency. |
| 10 | Index of First Occurrence in String | String search (.find()) | Reinventing the wheel isn’t smart – knowing your tools accelerates progress. |
| 11 | Valid Palindrome | Cleaning & reversing strings | Cleaning makes logic clearer — slow down and tidy up for robust solutions. |
| 12 | Valid Parentheses | Stack & dictionary matching | Order—both in code and life—ensures stability; pairs make clean exits. |
| 13 | Palindrome Number | Integer-to-string conversion | Changing formats clears confusion; symmetry emerges with simple transformations. |
| 14 | Plus One | Array-to-string/integer roundtrip | Sometimes the best way is the most direct—even if it retraces kindergarten math. |
| 15 | Factorial Trailing Zeroes | Division & counting factors | Optimization means knowing where zeros hide; divide, count, and spot what matters. |
| 16 | Sqrt(x) | Math library, code clarity | Less is more: embrace built-in solutions instead of overcomplicating. Simplicity often wins over brute force. |
| 17 | Pow(x, n) | Math power, toolkit trust | Elevation, trust reliable tools for power moves—delegation can be the smartest path to perfect performance. |
| 18 | Is Subsequence | Two-pointer technique | Turns out, life—and coding—is all about moving your pointers forward and hoping they eventually line up. |
| 19 | Two Sum II | Two-pointer technique | Sometimes, life’s trickiest sums just need a little teamwork. |
| 20 | Jump Game | Greedy Algorithm |  Success is all about knowing your current limits—and then pushing just a little further every step. |
| 21 | Roman to Integer | HashMap | Algorithms are as timeless as the classics. |
| 22 | Longest Common Prefix | Sorting | Even the biggest datasets have something they all share—sometimes it’s just a single letter, sometimes a lot more. |
| 23 | Jump Game II | Greedy Algorithm |  In code and in life, progress is about working smarter—making every leap count! |
| 24 | Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II | Greedy Algorithm | Grab every opportunity for profit by summing all upward price swings—don’t wait for one big sale, catch every small gain along the way. |
| 25 | Reverse Words in a String | Split and Join Methods | Sometimes, the simplest code can completely change your perspective—on strings and on problem solving. |
| 26 | H-Index | Counting Sort | Sorting and careful counting can turn a seemingly complex metric into a straightforward implementation—sometimes, organizing your data is all you need to find clarity. |
| 26 | Max Consecutive Ones | Array Traversal | Tracking streaks is about persistence—reset when needed, but always remember your highest count. The biggest wins come from recognizing and holding onto your longest runs | 
| 26 | Shuffle the Array | Array Traversal | Simplicity is powerful—a clever use of array multiplication can save lines of code and mental energy. Sometimes, the best solution is hiding in plain sight. |
| 26 | Concatenation of Array | Concat Operator | Divide and conquer isn’t just for big data! Breaking a problem into two neat parts and then interleaving them leads to elegant and efficient solutions—perfect for both arrays and everyday challenges. |
| 27 | Set Mismatch | Sets Duplicates | Every array, like every day, has its quirks—find the pattern, trust your tracking, and double-check your math. |
| 28 | Final Value of Variable After Performing Operations | Strings | Sometimes, tiny checks in a loop are all you need to automate decisions—no need for heavy logic! |
| 28 | Score of a String | ord() Function | The story is told not by values, but by how things change between steps |
| 29 | Find Words Containing Character | Search using in operator | A simple scan and quick check can turn boring data into powerful answers. In life and code, sometimes the best approach is: look, check, and record! |
| 30 | Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters | Sliding Windows | Consistency multiplies learning. If you stick to your routine, even basic daily progress adds up to real skill and confidence. |
| 31 | Check if Two String Arrays are Equivalent | Join Method | Sometimes the best way to understand complex, broken-up data is to put it all together and look at the big picture! |
| 32 | Add Two Numbers | Linked Lists | Sometimes, breaking a big math problem into tiny steps (nodes!) makes the logic easier and the solution cleaner. | 
| 33 | Reverse Integer | Type Conversion | Sometimes the trick isn’t in the reversal, but in the checks—always be careful when transforming data, especially if the rules might break! |
