# 🚀 100 Days of LeetCode — My Problem Solving Journey

Welcome to my **100 Days of LeetCode** challenge —  
a personal mission to master **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** in Python, sharpen problem-solving skills, and prepare for top tech interviews at Microsoft, Google, and beyond.

This repository is my open diary of logic, mistakes, breakthroughs, and consistency.  
It documents **every day** of my journey — from basic array manipulation to advanced graph algorithms and dynamic programming.

## 🧭 Why This Challenge?

I started this challenge not just to “solve questions,” but to:
- Build a daily habit of **structured problem-solving**.  
- Strengthen **DSA fundamentals** with hands-on coding.  
- Improve **debugging speed**, **pattern recognition**, and **logical clarity**.  
- Document progress publicly for accountability and reflection.  

Every solution here is written with clarity and understanding — not shortcuts.

## 🗓️ Journey Timeline

| Day | Problem | Concept | Takeaway |
|-----|----------|----------|-----------|
| 1 | Two Sum | Brute-force Search | Start simple. Understanding the problem beats guessing the shortcut. |
| 2 | Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock | Greedy Algorithm | The best profits come from patience — and one perfect moment of action. |
| 3 | Product of Array Except Self | Prefix & Suffix Arrays | Sometimes, what matters isn’t your own value — but the product of what’s around you. |
| 3 | Contains Duplicate | Set-based Lookup | Remove the noise early; repetition only slows progress. |
| 4 | Merge Sorted Array | In-place Merge + Sort | Order isn’t given — it’s built, element by element. |
| 5 | Remove Element | Two-pointer Technique | Knowing what to ignore is as important as knowing what to keep. |
| 6 | Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array | Two-pointer Overwrite | Progress means overwriting the old with what truly matters. |
| 6 | Majority Element | Sorting-based Majority | The truth sits right in the middle — if you’re willing to sort through the mess. |
| 7 | Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array II | Two-pointer Technique | Even repetition deserves balance — control, not chaos. |
